# JMTBAD muon-photon matching is done here using the default muon
# momentum and not whichever refit momentum will be eventually used in
# the analysis. For most muons this shouldn't make much difference as
# the matching is in eta-phi, but if the default is really bad and the
# selected refit manages to recover, the photon match may be
# wrong. The photon brem recovery needs to be studied more anyway.
